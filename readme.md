# Top 100 HN

Top 100 HN shows you the Top 100 HN articles at the moment.

## Why?

Integration with DomeCode would be cool. Users get to also look at HN news articles from DomeCode.

## Where?

- As a DomeCode Blog feature
- As a CLI tool to fetch this along with Blogs on DomeCode
- As a Qt app

### Possible Commands for CLI tool

```
domecode -blogs #lists top 10 blogs on DomeCode with links
domecode -b -hna #ask HN
domecode -b -hnn #new HN
domecode -b -hnt #top HN
domecode -b -hns #top show HN

```
The purpose of the CLI tool is to add to the accessibility of DomeCode. The CLI tool is going to be an open-source package. 

PROS :

- More open-source to build a community up on.
- CLI accessibility of DomeCode. Opportunity to advertise Discord and DomeCode in general.

To show that DomeCode is THE THING to work on, get in on it early.

Qt app - More like Apple News app but with links to projects and stuff on HN.

Note : All further development will take place on the DomeCode CLI repository.
